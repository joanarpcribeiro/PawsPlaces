Paws.Places was my second project at Ironhack - our first experience in building a full-stack application.
I was working with two more colleagues on this project. 
It consists in a website where you can find places to go with your dog. It was designed to work as a community where people can sign up to contribute to its growth, by adding new places that alllow dogs.


We used Handlebars.js, SCSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, MongoDB, Express.js and Node.js.
